Pull


git pull is a convenient shortcut for completing both git fetch and git
mergein the same command:

  $ git pull remotename branchname
  # Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work

Because pull performs a merge on the retrieved changes, you should ensure that
your local work is committed before running the pull command.  If you run into
a merge conflict[1] you cannot resolve, or if you decide to quit the merge,
you can use git merge --abort to take the branch back to where it was in before
you pulled.
