git-filter-branch - Rewrite branches


Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches mentioned in
the <rev-list options>, applying custom filters on each revision.  Those
filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite
on all files) or information about each commit.  Otherwise, all information
(including original commit times or merge information) will be preserved.

NOTE: This totally relates to being able copy files or directories
repo to repo.
