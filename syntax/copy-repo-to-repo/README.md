  git-filter-branch - Rewrite branches
  Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches mentioned in
  the <rev-list options>, applying custom filters on each revision.  Those
  filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite
  on all files) or information about each commit.  Otherwise, all information
  (including original commit times or merge information) will be preserved.
