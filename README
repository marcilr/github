cache-password.txt
  Cache password for git

  With git 1.7.9 or later, you can just use one of the following credential
  helpers:

  git config --global credential.helper cache
  ... which tells git to keep your password cached in memory for (by default)
  15 minutes. You can set a longer timeout with:

  git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"
