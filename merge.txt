Merge


Merging combines your local changes with changes made by others.

Typically, you'd merge a remote-tracking branch (i.e., a branch fetched from
a remote repository) with your local branch:

  $ git merge remotename/branchname
  # Merges updates made online with your local work

--github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/
