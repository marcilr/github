Clone


To grab a complete copy of another user's repository, use git clone like this:

  $ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
  # Clones a repository to your computer


When you run git clone, the following actions occur:
> A new folder called repo is made
> It is initialized as a Git repository
> A remote named origin is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from
> All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there
> The default branch (usually called master) is checked out

For every branch foo in the remote repository, a corresponding remote-tracking
branch refs/remotes/origin/foo is created in your local repository.  You can
usually abbreviate such remote-tracking branch names to origin/foo.
