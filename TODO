+++ Thu 13 Jan 2022 10:11:32 AM AKST - Malachite's github is throwing 
  an authentication error:

$ git push
Username for 'https://github.com': marcilr
Password for 'https://marcilr@github.com': 
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.
remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/marcilr/bin/'
$

Need to determine how to configure a personal access token for github.
