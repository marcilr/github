Test Connection


To make sure everything is working, you'll now try to SSH into GitHub.
When you do this, you will be asked to authenticate this action using
your password, which is the SSH key passphrase you created earlier.

1 - Open Terminal and enter:
  $ ssh -T git@github.com
  # Attempts to ssh to GitHub

Options:
  -T      Disable pseudo-tty allocation.
  -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh to print debugging messages about its
          progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection, authentication,
          and configuration problems.  Multiple -v options increase the
          verbosity.  The maximum is 3.
