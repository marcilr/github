Fetch


Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people.  Fetching from a
repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging
those changes into your own branches.

If you already have a local repository with a remote URL[1] set up for the
desired project, you can grab all the new information by using git fetch
*remotename* in the terminal:

  $ git fetch remotename
  # Fetches updates made to a remote repository

Otherwise, you can always add a new remote[2] and then fetch.
