Cache password for git

With git 1.7.9 or later, you can just use one of the following credential
helpers:

git config --global credential.helper cache
... which tells git to keep your password cached in memory for (by default)
15 minutes. You can set a longer timeout with:

git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"
