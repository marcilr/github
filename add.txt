Adding a remote


To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the
directory your repository is stored at.

The git remote add command takes two arguments:

> A remote name, for example, origin
> A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git

For example:
  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
  # Set a new remote

  $ git remote -v
  # Verify new remote
  # origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
  # origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

Not sure which URL to use? Check out "Which remote URL should I use?."[1]


Troubleshooting
===============
You may encounter these errors when trying to add a remote.

  Remote name already exists

This error means you've tried to add a remote with a name that already exists
in your local repository:

  git remote add origin https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
  # fatal: remote origin already exists.
To fix this, you can

> Use a different name for the new remote
> Rename the existing remote[2]
> Delete the existing remote[3]
